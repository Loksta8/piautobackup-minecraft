Raspberry Pi Autobackup for Minecraft server with NAS backup
I am creating this project to allow whoever is hosting a Minecraft game server, 
the ability to automate the process of warning players that the server will be brought down for creating backups, 
sftp the backup over to a remote NAS, and rebooting the server. This will all be done with the ease of mind knowing your backup 
is safe, not only on your local machine, but also on a remote NAS, that you host as well. 
All are welcome to help me make this more efficient and better as it evolves. 
Thank you and I hope it works for you all!
